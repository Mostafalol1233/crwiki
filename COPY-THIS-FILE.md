# 📌 EXACTLY WHAT TO DO - COPY THIS FILE

## The One File You Need

### Copy This:
```
C:\Users\asd\Downloads\New folder (11)\last\backend-deploy-full\seed-from-urls.js
```

### To Here:
```
Your Katabump Server → backend-deploy-full/seed-from-urls.js
```

---

## That's It!

Then run:
```bash
cd backend-deploy-full
AUTO_SEED=true npm run dev
```

Backend will automatically seed everything. Done! ✅

---

## Why This Works

The seed file now has:
- ✅ Catbox URLs for 10 mercenaries
- ✅ Catbox URLs for 28 weapons
- ✅ Catbox URLs for 13 game modes
- ✅ GitHub URLs for 12 more modes
- ✅ GitHub URLs for 100 ranks

When backend starts, it reads this file and seeds the database with all images.

The file should start with:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * seed-from-urls.js - HYBRID CATBOX + GITHUB URLS
 * Updated: November 16, 2025
